## Security

Scopuly is a decentralized cryptocurrency platform. This means that only the user has access to the funds and no one else. All financial transactions, such as trading, payments, account management ... all this interacts directly with the Stellar blockchain and is not dependent on any third party.

There is also an additional layer to protect your account - this is the installation of 2FA authorization to share the platform, as well as the installation of multi-signatures on wallets.

Since only the user has access to the secret key, locally from his device, without touching the server - the situation of general hacking and the withdrawal of all user funds is excluded.

Recent hacking stories of such well-known centralized exchanges as: Binance, Bithumb, Bitfinex, Bitstamp and many others .. billions of dollars of user funds were stolen. This is a big problem for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The fear of losing money from hacking into your wallet is a very serious problem for the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies.

The solution to this apparent problem is decentralized DEX platforms, where the users themselves own the funds, and not the hot or cold wallets of the centralized exchanges.

Scopuly is just such a dex platform. All operations in the wallet: authorization, trading, payments, account management, multi-signatures, issue of tokens, participation in IEO campaigns - all these operations are completely decentralized and interact directly with the Stellar blockchain.
